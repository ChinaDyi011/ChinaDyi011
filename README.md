👋 Hi, I’m Simbongile, but I like to be called China 😉

👀 I’m a passionate software engineer who loves to code, especially working on back-end development and APIs. I enjoy diving deep into HTTP methods and creating efficient, robust systems. On the front-end, I have experience building user-friendly pages and debugging UI issues to ensure a smooth user experience.

🌱 I have hands-on experience with Azure, including pushing code and debugging. I'm currently sharpening my skills with the AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials course and preparing to earn my AWS certification. My goal is to work for Amazon in the future, either as a DevOps Administrator or a Software Developer/Engineer.

🐳 I have extensive experience with Docker, from creating images to running and managing Docker containers. I find great satisfaction in debugging and solving complex issues within systems and code.

🖥️ I have strong skills in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and have worked closely with other software developers, including seniors, intermediates, and architects. I'm exposed to all aspects of software engineering and thrive in collaborative environments. I'm very friendly and can work independently, but I also excel as a team player.

🎥 Outside of coding, I have my own YouTube channel where I motivate others as a growing motivational speaker. I believe in the power of positivity and continuous learning.

💞️ I’m looking forward to one day working for Amazon, combining my technical skills with my passion for innovation.
